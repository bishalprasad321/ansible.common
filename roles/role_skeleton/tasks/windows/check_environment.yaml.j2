# The purpose of this file is to check the key aspects of the target host environment
# that will enable a successful 'apply'. For example, check if the url to download the 
# the package exists.
# The thinking is that these tasks should be called early in the playbook, such that
# the playbook can FAIL EARLY if there are environmental issues to be addressed. However,
# to call each role's check_environment.yaml against each equivalent inventory group
# will be expensive on the overall performance of the automation. It may be that this
# is not wanted all the time!
# Given this thinking, it is OK to test permissions etc by actually DOING some necessary
# tasks early in this file (rather than simply trying to test whether it ought to be
# possible for them to be done). However, given these tasks may not get called on every
# run, the doing of certain tasks here should not mean that those tasks can get
# substituted out of apply.yaml
